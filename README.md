# Korbs Studio
Hi, I'm Korbs, the developer of Dream Frame and FalixNodes Desktop app. I also build websites and mostly experience in HTML and CSS, this is also including Electron.

## Main Projects
### FalixNodes Software

FalixNodes Software was built for users to have a quicker access to their FalixNodes client, panel, and servers all through one place. We also include our help center in there if needed. The project started development and got released in December 2018 and became official with FalixNodes Limited. I've gained a lot of experience in Electron thanks to this project.

### Dream Frame (Discontinued)

Dream Frame was the first successful project I've built and created back in 2018, development started mid Feburary and released on May 1st.
The project was formly known as **Expose X**, as **Dream Frame** was not the first name picked for this project until 2019.

It was a theme built for Discord, supporting both mod clients known as Better Discord and Powercord. Giving the user interface of Discord a more clean and transisent look for the user to enjoy. Also allowing more custom options for variables like custom background, adjustments to user backgrounds, colors, and the small bits.

Since Feburary of 2021, the project has been fully discontinued.
